### Hi, I'm Nobody âœ¨

Behind my pseudo, I'm Clara, a 21yo developer and artist based in France. I'm currently pursuing a Master at JUNIA ISEN in Lille. 

I'm mainly focusing on front-end, video games and graphism.
With some friends, we create [Tavernak](https://github.com/Clara-gille/Taverne), a lil' game made in C# during just a few weeks.
And now, I'm developing and coding a video game based in space !
